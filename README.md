# Adventure Game

### Required concepts
- Variables
- Input/output
- If-statements
- Looping

Create a game where the user can make decisions and work through a simple story. Put your working, most up-to-date code in `main.py`. Group members may choose to create other files to work within temporarily and to isolate their own contributions.

ALthough this is a groups project, each member will be assessed individually based on their contributions. If a particular member is not contributing, they will be asked to decouple from the group and turn in something on their own.


## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Get assignment and get into groups
- **Day 3**: Get feedback on GitHub **(worth 40%)**
- Address/resolve feedback and prep for final submission
- **Day 6**: Final submission assessed (only if feedback has been addressed) **(worth 60%)**


## Submission requirements
1. Each member must clearly mark their code with a comment indicating who did what.

    ```python
    # MR. GALLO
    if code_not_attributed:
        mark = 0
    ```
    It will not be acceptable for multiple group memebers to contribute on all the code. There must be clear and substantial spans of code that were written by only one person.

2. Each member will pick examples from their own code highlighting each of the required concepts (more focus on if-statements and loops) and *be able to explain the code* as well as answer questions.
3. The group will have a conference call with the teacher to present their program. This means everyone needs a working microphone. If this is an issue, please let me know **as soon as possible**.
