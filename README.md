# Adventure Game

### Required concepts
- Variables
- Input/output
- If-statements
- Looping

Create a game where the user can make decisions and work through a simple story. Put your working, most up-to-date code in main.py. Group members may choose to create other files to work within temporarily and to isolate their own contributions.


## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Get assignment and get into groups
- **Day 3**: Get feedback on GitHub **(worth 40%)**
- Address/resolve feedback and prep for final submission
- **Day 6**: Final submission assessed (only if feedback has been addressed) **(worth 60%)**


## Submission requirements
1. Each member must clearly mark their code with a comment indicating who did what.

    ```python
    # MR. GALLO
    if code_not_attributed:
        mark = 0
    ```

2. Each member will pick examples from their own code highlighting each of the required concepts (more focus on if-statements and loops) and *be able to explain the code* as well as answer questions.
3. The group will have a conference call with the teacher to present their program. This means everyone needs a working microphone. If this is an issue, please let me know **as soon as possible**.
